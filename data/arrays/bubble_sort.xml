  <name>Bubble Sort</name>
  <description>
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted, with the largest elements "bubbling" up to their correct positions in each iteration. 

While bubble sort is easy to implement and understand, its time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), making it inefficient for large datasets. However, it can be optimized to stop early if no swaps are made during an iteration, indicating that the list is already sorted.
